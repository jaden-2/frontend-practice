<h1>Challenge day 1</h1>

<h3>Learning outcome</h3>

<p>
    <ul>
        Things I learnt
        <li>When building components simplify the problem to basic units and build from there</li>
        <li>Grid is your friend, flex can get messy easy</li>
         <li>Disrupting the flow of the document can lead to UI that is difficult to manage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Figure out a better way to break an element from the document flow to achieve interesting designs and layout. Setting position to absolute create absolute chaos 😏😉</p>
